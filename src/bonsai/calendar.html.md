# Calendar

This calendar is tailored to the specific [climate](/gardening/climate) and
[species](/bonsai/species) of bonsai that I'm growing, and it should be
adjusted to fit local conditions.

The precise timing of activities may vary each year based on environmental
factors. However, there are some key events in the annual cycle of a tree:

- Bud push in early to mid spring is the time of the year when the tree reaches
  its maximum energy storage, making it the ideal time for repotting, and a
  very good time for structural pruning if the species is not prone to bleeding.
- Post-flush harden in late spring to early summer is a good time for pruning
  (with partial defoliation for some species) or decandling (for black pines)
  to encourage a second flush of growth and back budding.
- Leaf drop in fall is a good time to prune species that are at risk of
  bleeding if pruned in spring.
