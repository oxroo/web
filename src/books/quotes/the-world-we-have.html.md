Author: Thich Nhat Hanh (2008)

## Quotes

> When we fight against the nature of impermanence, we suffer. We can allow our
> fear, anger, and despair to overwhelm us. That's why it is very important to
> deal with our fear and despair before we can deal with the issue of global
> warming and other environmental concerns.

<!---->

> If we don't recognize the fear inside us, it will continue to shape our
> behavior.

> If we only see the wave with its manifestations of being born and dying, we
> will suffer. But if we see the water, which is the basis of the wave, and we
> see that all the waves are returning to water, we have nothing to fear.

> We have to accept death; it makes life possible. The cells in our bodies are
> dying every day, but we never think to organize a funeral for them. The death
> of one cell allows the birth of another. Life and death are two aspects of
> the same reality. We must learn to die peacefully so that others may live.

> We are all children of the Earth, and, at some time, she will take us back to
> herself again. We are continually arising from Mother Earth, being nurtured
> by her, and then returning to her. All life is impermanent. Like us, plants
> are born, live for a period of time, and then return to the Earth. When they
> decompose, they fertilize our gardens. Living vegetables and decomposing
> vegetables are part of the same reality. Without one, the other cannot be.

> Our Sangha aspires to live in harmony with the land, with all the vegetation
> and animals, and with all our brothers and sisters. When we are in harmony
> with each other, we are also in harmony with the land.
