# About

My passion for bonsai started in 1997 after reading books about them and
visiting the first websites dedicated to them. My first tree was a Zelkova
serrata and I quickly became hooked. Almost 3 decades later I still distinctly
remember choosing it from the nursery and spending time misting it and being in
awe in front of such a small tree in a pot.

I quickly started a collection with whatever I could get my hands on and made
one of the first bonsai website in France the next summer. But at the time most
advices from the books were not very helpful and I lost all those trees in the
following years.

I restarted the collection while being at the university in 2004 and at that
time the information we could read on the internet became much better. I was
more successful in growing them, thanks to the online community and modern
substrates.

Unfortunately after graduation in 2010 I moved far away for work and couldn't
really take care of them anymore until 2020 when my life became stable enough
to have a new home for the few that had survived my absence and hundred of new
trees.
