# Climate

My garden is situated in the hills of Brittany, approximately 30 km from the
sea. The weather is generally mild, with frequent rain from the Atlantic and
occasional winter storms (maritime climate, zone 9a).

The temperature tends to have a wider range than in nearby coastal areas. The
first frost does not occur before November but the last frost can extend into
early May.

Summers typically last 3 to 5 months with temperatures consistently above
10 °C and less rain than in winter.
